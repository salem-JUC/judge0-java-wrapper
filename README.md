# Java API Wrapper for Judge0API

A lightweight Java library that wraps around the Judge0 REST API to make it easy to submit code, run test cases, and retrieve results â€” without having to manually handle JSON, HTTP requests, or Base64 encoding.

## âœ¨ Features
- Simple API for creating and submitting code to the Judge0 service.
- Automatically encodes `source_code`, `stdin`, and `expected_output` to **Base64** â€” you only provide plain text.
- Retrieve submission results directly or via a token-based flow.
- Designed with a clean builder pattern for flexibility.
- Execute one code with multiple test cases to validate its correctness against different inputs and expected outputs.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Using Maven (local build)
Clone the repository and install it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
mvn clean install
```
## ðŸš€ Getting Started

# Build the Judge0Client
```bash
Judge0Client client = new Judge0Client.Builder()
    .baseUrl("https://api.judge0.com")
    .apiKey("your-api-key") // if required
    .build();
```

# Create a Submission
```bash
Submission submission = new Submission.Builder()
    .languageId(52) // Example: 52 = Java
    .sourceCode("""
        public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello World");
            }
        }
    """)
    .stdin("Input data here")
    .expectedOutput("Hello World")
    .build();
```
You do not need to Base64 encode your values â€” the wrapper does it for you.

# Two Ways to Get Submission Results
```bash
  // **Direct Submission** â€“ Submit your code and immediately get the result.
SubmissionResult result = client.submitAndGetResult(submission);

  // **Token-Based Submission** â€“ Submit your code, receive a token, and fetch the result later using that token.
String token = client.submitAndGetToken(submission);

// Later, fetch result by token
SubmissionResult result = client.getSubmission(token);

```
